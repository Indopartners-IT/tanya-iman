"""Copy parity between backend and client.

The greeting the seeker reads on first load is rendered by the client; the same
greeting is what the backend considers canonical. Two copies of a string that
must match is a defect waiting to happen, so this test asserts they do.

Multi-paragraph strings (refusal, no_grounding, fallback) live only in the
backend — the client renders them from `answer_text` — so they are not compared.
