"""Text measurement shared by the runtime validator and the admin editor.

There is exactly one word-counting function in this project, and this is it.
The admin editor's live counter (Admin UX section 10) imports the same rule via
``web/shared``. If the editor says 249 and the backend says 251, the editor
stops trusting the tool and live validation becomes worse than useless.

Any change here must be mirrored in web/shared/src/word-count.ts, and
tests/test_text.py plus web/shared's test cover the same edge cases.
