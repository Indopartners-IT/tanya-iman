/**
 * Word counting for the admin answer editor's live counter.
 *
 * This is a deliberate port of backend/services/text.py, not an independent
 * implementation. The backend validator is what actually blocks publication
 * (F-11, 25-250 words); if this counter disagrees with it, an editor sees
 * "248 words" and then gets rejected on save, and stops trusting the tool.
 *
 * Any change here must be mirrored in backend/services/text.py, and the test
 * cases in word-count.test.ts are duplicated in backend/tests/test_text.py.
