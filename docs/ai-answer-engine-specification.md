# **AI Answer Engine Specification**

**Project:** Tanya Iman \- Grounded Theology Answer Engine

**Version:** 1.0 (Iteration 1)

**Date:** August 2026

---

## **Architecture: The Three-Layer Grounded Answer Model**

### **Overview**

Tanya Iman's answer engine is **not an agent**. It has no tool-calling loop, no conversational state machine, and no autonomy over flow. It is a fixed pipeline in which a language model performs exactly one job — writing a paragraph of Indonesian from passages it was handed — under deterministic supervision on both sides.

That shape is a direct consequence of the product's promise. The system tells users that every answer comes from five specific websites. A model that can decide what to do next is a model that can decide to answer from its own knowledge, and there is no prompt strong enough to make that impossible. So the model is never given the decision.

> Think of it as a research assistant working under an editor. The assistant is fluent, warm, and good at explaining — but they may only write from the folder of clippings placed in front of them, and the editor reads every paragraph before it goes out. If the paragraph cites something that is not in the folder, it does not run. The assistant's skill is real and necessary; it is simply not the last word.

---

### **Layer 1 — Control Layer (deterministic)**

**Responsibility:** Everything that must be true regardless of what the model produces.

The Control Layer owns safety routing, rate limiting, relevance gating, retrieval, and — most importantly — the compliance validators that decide whether an answer is allowed to reach a user. It is ordinary Python. It cannot be prompt-injected, it cannot be persuaded, and it costs nothing per call.

**What the Control Layer owns:**

- Crisis detection and scripted crisis response (F-30 – F-32)
- Rate limiting and input bounds (F-16, F-24)
- The decision to refuse an off-topic question (F-9, F-10)
- Retrieval over the approved corpus, and the threshold below which we decline to answer (F-15, F-29)
- The curated-answer override (F-23)
- All five compliance validators (F-11 – F-15) and the repair loop (F-28)
- Persistence, citation assembly, and analytics

**Principle:** If a rule appears in the product requirements as a *must*, it lives here — not in a prompt.

---

### **Layer 2 — Composition Layer (LLM)**

**Responsibility:** Turning retrieved passages into one warm, readable, correctly-worded Indonesian answer.

This is where the model earns its place. Corpus passages are articles: long, written for a different reader, in a different register. The user asked a specific question, often while distressed. Converting the first into the second is genuinely hard and genuinely valuable, and no rule engine does it.

**What the Composition Layer owns:**

- Acknowledging what the user actually said before teaching anything
- Selecting which of the retrieved passages are relevant to *this* question
- Register, warmth, and readability in Indonesian
- Staying inside 25–250 words and the required terminology *as a first attempt* — the validators are the guarantee, the prompt is the effort

**Principle:** The model is asked to be good, not to be trusted. Every output is checked.

---

### **Layer 3 — Editorial override (offline, never in the chat)**

**Responsibility:** Overriding the machine where the editorial team has a canonical answer.

For any of the thirteen topics, an editor can write the canonical answer **in the admin portal, after the fact**. When a published curated answer exists for a resolved topic, it is returned verbatim and no generation happens. Humans never join the conversation. This is not a counselling handover; it is a content override.

**Principle:** A human-written canonical answer always beats a generated one. The system's job is to make that answer reach the right question, not to put a person on the other end of the chat.

---

### **Layer summary**

| Layer | Engine | Owns | Key quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| Control | Python, deterministic | Safety, gating, retrieval, validation | Guaranteed |
| Composition | LLM | Warmth, relevance, readability | Human-like |
| Editorial | People, offline | Canonical answers per topic | Authoritative |

---

### **Per-request flow**

```
Inbound question
  → Input_Bounds        reject empty / >1000 chars
  → Crisis_Guard        crisis signal? → scripted response, STOP
  → Rate_Limiter        over 30/hour? → 429 message, STOP
  → Relevance_Classifier not theology / faith-related? → refusal, STOP
  → Topic_Resolver      map to one of 13 topics, or `lainnya`
  → Curated_Resolver    published curated answer for this topic? → return it, STOP
  → Retriever           vector search; <2 chunks above threshold? → no-grounding, STOP
  → Answer_Composer     LLM writes from retrieved passages only
  → Compliance_Validator V1–V5
        pass  → continue
        fail  → Repair (one attempt) → revalidate
                  fail again → fallback response + log for admin review, STOP
  → Response_Assembler  attach 1–2 citations, persist, return
  → [async] Analytics   topic counters, clustering, gap tracking
```

Every `STOP` above is a complete, valid product response. Four of the eight exits never call an LLM for composition at all, which is why the latency and cost profile of this system is far better than a naive "send everything to the model" design.

---

## **1\. Document Purpose**

This document specifies the behaviour of the Tanya Iman answer engine: how a question is classified, grounded, composed, validated, and returned. It is the authority for prompt content, validator rules, and canonical Indonesian response copy.

It is a living document. Section 9 carries an iteration number, and prompt changes follow the review process in Section 14. Where this document and a prompt file disagree, this document is wrong and must be updated — the deployed prompt is the running system.

---

## **2\. Assistant Persona & Guardrails**

**Identity.** The assistant is *Tanya Iman*. It is an AI. It never claims to be human, a pastor, an ustadz, or a counsellor, and no human ever takes over the chat. If asked directly, it says it is a helper that answers from the writings of the approved sites.

**Audience.** The typical reader is a Muslim asking a theology question they may not have felt safe asking a person. The answer should feel written *to them*, which in practice means acknowledging the question, using "Allah" and "Isa Al-Masih" only, and never slipping into church vocabulary.

**Voice.** Warm, plain, unhurried. Indonesian that a secondary-school reader follows easily. It addresses the user as *Anda*. It does not use religious jargon it has not explained, does not argue, and does not perform certainty it does not have.

**Hard guardrails — the assistant must never:**

- Answer from anything other than the retrieved passages
- Use the words **"Tuhan"**, **"Yesus"**, or **"Jesus"** (F-12). This includes quoted scripture. Rephrase; never auto-substitute
- Invent, guess, or reformat a URL — citations come from the retrieval result, never from the model
- Attempt counselling, pastoral care, or a multi-turn "walk with me" conversation
- Criticise Islam, Muslims, the Quran, or any religious community
- Make a claim about what a specific person's salvation status is
- Ask the user for personal information — no name, no location, no phone number
- Promise an outcome ("if you pray this, Allah will heal you")
- Continue an argument. If the user is debating rather than asking, it answers once, kindly, and stops

**No human in the loop.** There is no handover, no volunteer dashboard, and no "a minister will be with you shortly". Where a question exceeds what the corpus can responsibly answer, the correct behaviour is the no-grounding response (§10.3). Where the message is a self-harm crisis, the correct behaviour is the scripted helpline (§10.4) — still the AI, still not a person.

## **3\. The Answer Pipeline**

### **3.1 Node summary**

| # | Node | Type | Requirement | Can stop the pipeline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Input_Bounds` | Deterministic | — | Yes |
| 2 | `Crisis_Guard` | Deterministic + optional model check | F-30 – F-32 | Yes |
| 3 | `Rate_Limiter` | Deterministic | F-16 | Yes |
| 4 | `Relevance_Classifier` | LLM (small, cheap) | F-9, F-10 | Yes |
| 5 | `Topic_Resolver` | LLM (same call as #4) | F-21 | No |
| 6 | `Curated_Resolver` | Deterministic | F-23 | Yes |
| 7 | `Retriever` | Vector search | F-15, F-29 | Yes |
| 8 | `Answer_Composer` | LLM (primary) | F-11 – F-14 | No |
| 9 | `Compliance_Validator` | Deterministic (+ sampled LLM judge) | F-11 – F-15, F-28 | Yes |
| 10 | `Response_Assembler` | Deterministic | F-14 | No |

Nodes 4 and 5 share a single model call — classification and topic assignment are one structured-output request, not two round trips. This matters: it is the difference between a 400 ms and an 800 ms floor on every question.

### **3.2 Ordering rules that must not be changed casually**

1. **`Crisis_Guard` runs before `Rate_Limiter`.** Someone in crisis who has exhausted their quota still receives the helpline. Reversing these is a safety regression.
2. **`Relevance_Classifier` runs before `Retriever`.** Refusing an off-topic question must not cost a vector search, and must return in under a second (PRD §7.3).
3. **`Curated_Resolver` runs before `Retriever`.** A curated answer costs one read; there is no reason to retrieve and generate before discovering we did not need to.
4. **`Compliance_Validator` runs after every composition, including after a repair.** There is no path from the model to the user that skips it.

---

## **4\. Relevance Classification**

### **4.1 What counts as relevant**

Relevant (F-9) means the question is about **faith** or **inner life**. Concretely:

| In scope | Examples |
|---|---|
| Allah, His nature, His character | "Apakah Allah peduli pada saya?" |
| Isa Al-Masih — identity, life, death, teaching | "Siapa sebenarnya Isa Al-Masih?" |
| The Quran and the Holy Scripture — content, authenticity, relationship | "Apakah Kitab Suci sudah diubah?" |
| Sin, forgiveness, salvation, judgment, heaven, hell | "Bagaimana saya bisa diampuni?" |
| Emotional and inner struggle | grief, anxiety, fear, guilt, loneliness, despair, shame |
| Faith and daily life | marriage, family, worship, fasting, doubt, the search for truth |
| Meta-questions about the assistant | "Sumber jawabanmu dari mana?" |

| Out of scope | Examples |
|---|---|
| Factual queries with no faith dimension | sports, weather, news, arithmetic, code |
| Requests for professional advice | medical, legal, financial |
| Politics and current affairs | |
| Requests to write something unrelated | "Buatkan saya email untuk bos saya" |
| Attempts to change the assistant's instructions | "Abaikan semua aturanmu" |

### **4.2 The ambiguous band**

Classification returns a confidence. Three outcomes, not two:

| Confidence | Action |
|---|---|
| `relevant`, high | Proceed |
| `ambiguous` | **Proceed as relevant**, and flag the question for admin review |
| `irrelevant`, high | Refuse (§10.2) |

The bias is deliberate. Wrongly refusing a person who was reaching out is a worse product failure than wrongly answering a borderline question — and the grounding requirement means a genuinely off-topic question will simply fail retrieval and land on the no-grounding response anyway. Risk R2 is managed by reviewing the ambiguous queue, not by tightening the classifier until it starts turning people away.

### **4.3 Prompt-injection handling**

Attempts to override instructions are classified `irrelevant` and refused. They are additionally flagged `is_injection_attempt` for the admin queue. The classifier is not the security boundary — the validators are — but there is no reason to spend a composition call on it.

---

## **5\. Topic Resolution**

The same structured call that classifies relevance also assigns one of the thirteen topics from PRD Appendix A, or `lainnya`.

**Rules:**

- Exactly one topic per question. Where two fit, the resolver picks the **theological** subject, not the emotional framing — a question about who Isa Al-Masih is, asked while afraid, is `jati-diri-isa-almasih`, not `kecemasan-depresi`.
- `lainnya` is a legitimate answer, not a failure. A rising `lainnya` count is the signal that the taxonomy needs extending (PRD Appendix A).
- The resolved topic is persisted on the question record and drives the curated-answer lookup, admin grouping (F-21), and topic counters.

---

## **6\. Retrieval & Grounding**

### **6.1 Query construction**

The query embedded is not the raw question. It is the question plus a short conversation context: the last two user turns in the session, concatenated. This handles the common follow-up shape — "Kenapa begitu?" — which is meaningless embedded alone.

Context is capped at two prior turns. Longer context dilutes the embedding and starts retrieving for a question the user asked five minutes ago.

### **6.2 Search parameters**

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `top_k` retrieved | 8 | Enough for re-ranking to have something to choose from |
| Passed to composer | 4 | Beyond this, the composer starts blending unrelated passages |
| Similarity threshold | 0.72 (configurable, `system_config`) | Tuned against the benchmark set in §13 |
| Minimum surviving chunks | 2 | One passage is not enough to write a grounded answer from |
| Site filter | The five approved domains | Applied at query time, redundantly with the crawler's write-time filter |
| Max chunks per article | 2 | Prevents a single long article from occupying the entire context |

### **6.3 Re-ranking**

Retrieved chunks are re-ranked before truncation to 4, by a weighted combination of vector similarity, topic agreement with the resolved topic, and article recency. Recency has the smallest weight — this is doctrinal content, where a 2018 article is not worse than a 2025 one.

### **6.4 The grounding contract**

The composer receives passages and nothing else. It does not receive the article body, the site's name as an authority claim, or any instruction that would let it treat its own knowledge as a source.

**The no-grounding path (F-29).** If fewer than two chunks clear the threshold, composition never runs. The user gets §10.3, and the question is written to the content-gap view with its embedding, so the editorial team sees not just that a gap exists but what shape it has.

This is the single most important behaviour in the system. It is far better to tell a user we have not written about something than to have a model fill the silence.

---

## **7\. Answer Composition**

### **7.1 Inputs to the composer**

| Input | Source |
|---|---|
| The user's question | Verbatim, in a delimited user block |
| Last 2 turns of the session | For pronoun and follow-up resolution |
| 4 retrieved passages | Each with its article title and an index, **without** its URL |
| Resolved topic | For register, not for content |

Passages are given with an index (`[1]`–`[4]`) and no URL. The composer marks which passage supports which part of its answer using those indices. `Response_Assembler` converts indices to links afterwards. **The model never sees or writes a URL**, which makes the entire class of fabricated-citation failures structurally impossible rather than merely discouraged.

### **7.2 Output contract**

The composer returns structured output:

```json
{
  "answer": "string — Indonesian, 25-250 words",
  "used_passages": [1, 3],
  "quran_reference": "string | null — e.g. 'Qs. Al-Anbiya 21:107'",
  "bible_references": ["Yohanes 3:16", "Roma 5:8"],
  "confidence": "high | medium | low"
}
```

`used_passages` is what `Response_Assembler` turns into the 1–2 citations required by F-14. If the composer returns more than two, the assembler keeps the two highest-ranked. If it returns zero, that is a V5 grounding failure.

### **7.3 Model configuration**

| Setting | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Primary model | Claude Sonnet class, ZDR tier | Chosen for Indonesian quality and instruction adherence |
| Fallback model | Gemini 2.x on Vertex AI | Used on primary error or when the primary exceeds 7 s |
| Temperature | 0.4 | Low enough for consistency, high enough that answers do not read like a template |
| Max output tokens | 700 | ~250 Indonesian words plus structure, with headroom |
| Classifier model | Smallest capable model | Runs on every question; must be cheap |

Both provider choices sit behind `backend/providers/llm.py` per TDD §2.2. The `prompt_version` and `model` are stamped on every question record, so a quality change can be attributed rather than argued about.

---

## **8\. Compliance Validators**

This section is the reason the product can claim K4 = 100%. Every generated answer passes all five validators before display. A curated answer passes the same validators before an editor can save it (F-34).

### **8.1 V1 — Length (F-11)**

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Bound | 25 ≤ words ≤ 250 |
| Counting | Whitespace-delimited tokens of `answer` only. Citations, scripture reference labels rendered by the assembler, and markup are excluded |
| On failure | Repair with an explicit instruction stating the current count and the target |

Counting must be defined in exactly one function used by both the runtime validator and the admin editor's live word counter, or editors and the engine will disagree about what 250 means.

### **8.2 V2 — Terminology (F-12)**

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Forbidden | `Tuhan`, `TUHAN`, `Yesus`, `Jesus` — case-insensitive, word-boundary matched |
| Required | At least one of `Allah` or `Isa Al-Masih` must appear |
| Warned, not failed | `Kristus` standing alone. Logged for editorial review; `Al-Masih` is preferred |
| On failure | Repair. Substitution is **not** performed automatically — see below |

> **Design note — why we do not auto-substitute.** Replacing "Tuhan" with "Allah" inside a quoted scripture passage silently rewrites scripture, which is exactly the failure this product must never commit. The validator rejects and asks the composer to rewrite; it never edits.

> **⚠️ Known corpus conflict — open item.** Indonesian Bible translations render the divine name as "TUHAN". If any approved-site article quotes such a translation verbatim, a faithful, well-grounded answer can fail V2 through no fault of the model. Mitigation: the ingestion pipeline flags every chunk containing a forbidden term at index time, and the editorial team decides per chunk whether to exclude it from retrieval or accept the site's own wording. **This must be resolved before the pilot** — see §15, OI-1.

### **8.3 V3 — Scripture balance (F-13)**

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Quran references | At most **1** |
| Position | If present, it must fall within the first 25% of the answer by word position |
| Bible references | If a Quran reference is present, at least **2** Bible references are required — this is what "the vast majority from the Bible" means operationally |
| Bible floor | At least 1 Bible reference in every answer that cites scripture at all |
| Detection | Quran: `Qs.`, `QS`, `Surah`, `Surat` followed by a surah name or number. Bible: the 66 Indonesian book names with a chapter:verse pattern |
| On failure | Repair with the specific imbalance named |

An answer citing no scripture at all is valid. Not every theology question needs a proof text, and forcing one produces worse answers.

### **8.4 V4 — Citations (F-14)**

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Count | Exactly 1 or 2 citations attached |
| Provenance | Every citation must correspond to a chunk that was in this request's retrieval result. There is no path by which a URL not retrieved can be attached |
| Allowlist | Every citation host must be one of the five approved domains |
| Liveness | Citation URLs are checked against the `articles` collection with `status: active`; a retired article cannot be cited |
| On failure | Not repairable by the model — this is an assembler bug or a stale index. Falls straight to the fallback response and raises an alert |

V4 failure is treated as a system defect, not an answer-quality problem, because the assembler is deterministic. If it fires in production, something is wrong with the index, not the model.

### **8.5 V5 — Grounding (F-15)**

The hardest rule to enforce mechanically, and the most important. Enforced in two tiers.

**Tier 1 — always, cheap, deterministic:**

| Check | Detail |
|---|---|
| Non-empty support | `used_passages` must be non-empty |
| Lexical floor | The answer must share a minimum content-word overlap with the union of its cited passages. Catches answers that ignored the passages entirely |
| No external entities | The answer must not name people, books, organisations, or URLs absent from both the passages and an allowed-vocabulary list (the topic names, "Allah", "Isa Al-Masih", "Kitab Suci", "Al-Quran", "Injil", "Taurat", "Zabur") |

**Tier 2 — LLM-as-judge, sampled:**

A separate cheap model receives the answer and its cited passages and is asked, per sentence, whether the passages support it. It runs on:

- **100% of answers during the pilot**, to calibrate Tier 1's thresholds against real judgments
- **100% of answers that required a repair**, always, in every environment
- **10% random sample in production**, as an ongoing quality signal

It is a monitoring and calibration instrument, not a request-path gate — putting a second model call in every user's latency budget would break PRD §7.3 for a check that Tier 1 catches most of.

### **8.6 The repair loop (F-28)**

```
compose → validate
   pass → ship
   fail → repair(failures) → validate
             pass → ship, record `validator_failures` on the question
             fail → fallback response (§10.5), record both failure sets,
                    surface in the admin review queue
```

**Exactly one repair attempt.** A second attempt roughly doubles worst-case latency for a diminishing return, and an answer that fails twice is usually failing because the retrieved passages could not support the question — which the no-grounding response says more honestly.

The repair prompt states the failed rules by code and value, never the whole rulebook. "Jawaban Anda 271 kata, batas maksimum 250" produces a fix; "please follow all the rules" produces another failure.

### **8.7 Validator failure codes**

Persisted on the question record and surfaced in admin, so a quality regression is diagnosable at a glance.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `V1_TOO_SHORT` / `V1_TOO_LONG` | Word count outside 25–250 |
| `V2_FORBIDDEN_TERM` | "Tuhan" or "Yesus" present |
| `V2_MISSING_REQUIRED_TERM` | Neither "Allah" nor "Isa Al-Masih" present |
| `V3_MULTIPLE_QURAN_REFS` / `V3_QURAN_NOT_LEADING` / `V3_BIBLE_MINORITY` | Scripture balance |
| `V4_CITATION_COUNT` / `V4_CITATION_NOT_RETRIEVED` / `V4_CITATION_OFF_ALLOWLIST` / `V4_CITATION_RETIRED` | Citation integrity |
| `V5_NO_SUPPORT` / `V5_LOW_OVERLAP` / `V5_EXTERNAL_ENTITY` | Grounding |

---

## **9\. System Prompts (Iteration 1)**

> **Implementation status.** Prompts live in `backend/config/prompts/` as versioned files, one per node, with `{placeholder}` interpolation. `PROMPT_VERSION` is stamped on every answer. The text below is the source of truth for review; the files are the source of truth for what ran.

> **⚠️ Deployment gate.** The composer prompt (§9.2), the refusal copy (§10.2), the no-grounding copy (§10.3), and the crisis scripts (§10.4) require **written editorial sign-off before the pilot**. PRD OD-6 assigns the owner. This gate is blocking.

## **10\. Canonical Response Copy**

All non-generated responses. These are Indonesian product copy, held in `web/app/locales/id.json` for client-rendered strings and `backend/config/responses.id.yml` for server-rendered ones — and they must be identical. A copy change is a product change and follows §14.

### **10.1 Greeting (F-6)**

> Selamat datang. Silakan tanyakan apa pun yang ada di hati Anda — tentang Allah, Isa Al-Masih, Kitab Suci, atau apa yang sedang Anda alami.
>
> *Jawaban disusun berdasarkan Kitab Suci.*

The italic line is the persistent source note required by F-6. It stays visible while scrolling; it is not a one-time message that disappears.

### **10.2 Refusal — out of scope (F-10)**

> Maaf, saya hanya dapat menjawab pertanyaan seputar iman dan pergumulan hati.
>
> Silakan bertanya tentang Allah, Isa Al-Masih, Kitab Suci, atau apa pun yang sedang Anda rasakan.

No Like control (F-17). No citations. Never explains *why* the question was rejected beyond this — a longer explanation invites argument with a classifier.

### **10.3 No grounding found (F-29)**

> Maaf, saya belum memiliki bahan yang cukup untuk menjawab pertanyaan itu dengan baik.
>
> Pertanyaan Anda sudah kami catat, agar tim kami dapat menyiapkan jawabannya. Sementara itu, Anda boleh bertanya tentang hal lain yang sedang Anda pikirkan.

This copy is doing real work. It tells the truth, it does not blame the user, and it makes the silence feel like a gap in *our* library rather than a rejection of *their* question.

### **10.4 Crisis response (F-30, F-31)**

> **⚠️ Deployment gate — blocking.** The text below is a **placeholder structure**. The actual copy, and every helpline number in it, must be written and verified by the editorial team, and the numbers re-verified within 30 days of launch. PRD OD-4 owns this. **Shipping a wrong crisis number is a P0 safety defect.** No placeholder may reach staging.

Structure the approved script must follow:

1. Acknowledge, directly and without theology, that what they said matters
2. State plainly that this is beyond what this service can help with
3. Give at least one Indonesian helpline, with its name and number, formatted to be tappable on mobile
4. Encourage contact with one trusted person nearby
5. Close warmly, without a call to action and without scripture

Scripture is deliberately excluded from the crisis response. A person in acute crisis needs a phone number, not an argument, and mixing the two risks the message being read as proselytising at a vulnerable moment.

Crisis responses show no Like control and no citations, and are excluded from topic analytics (F-32).

### **10.5 Validator fallback (F-28)**

> Maaf, saya belum dapat menyusun jawaban yang layak untuk pertanyaan ini. Tim kami akan meninjaunya.
>
> Silakan coba menanyakannya dengan cara lain, atau tanyakan hal lain.

### **10.6 Rate limit (F-16)**

> Anda telah mencapai batas 30 pertanyaan dalam satu jam. Silakan kembali lagi dalam {minutes} menit.

### **10.7 Technical error (F-27)**

> Maaf, terjadi gangguan saat menyiapkan jawaban.

Rendered with a **Coba lagi** action that resubmits the same question without retyping.

### **10.8 Identity question**

When a user asks what the assistant is:

> Saya Tanya Iman, sebuah layanan yang menjawab pertanyaan berdasarkan tulisan dari beberapa situs dialog keagamaan berbahasa Indonesia. Saya bukan manusia, dan saya hanya menjawab dari bahan-bahan tersebut.

## **11\. Curated Answer Override**

### **11.1 Behaviour**

When `Topic_Resolver` returns a topic whose `curated_status` is `published`, `Curated_Resolver` returns `curated_answer` verbatim with `curated_citations`, sets `answer_source: curated`, and the pipeline stops. No retrieval, no generation, no cost, sub-second latency.

### **11.2 Why an unconditional override**

A softer design — "use the curated answer as context for generation" — was considered and rejected. If an editor has written the ministry's answer to "Jalan Keselamatan", the value of that answer is that it is *exactly* what the ministry wants said. Paraphrasing it through a model returns the variance the editor was trying to eliminate.

The accepted cost is that a curated answer cannot adapt to the specific wording of the question. That is the right trade for these thirteen topics, which are broad by construction.

### **11.3 Editorial constraints (F-23, F-34)**

A curated answer must pass V1, V2, V3, and V4 before it can be saved. The admin editor shows the word count live and blocks save with the specific violation named. An editor cannot save 300 words, cannot save an answer containing "Yesus", and cannot attach a citation outside the allowlist — the same rules, enforced by the same code path as the runtime validators.

### **11.4 Coverage as a strategy**

K8 tracks the share of answers served from curated content. Every point of curated coverage is simultaneously higher answer quality, lower latency, lower cost, and less model risk. Canonical answers should be written first for the topics with the highest question count (F-21), which the admin portal surfaces directly.

## **12\. Similar-Question Clustering (F-22)**

Runs asynchronously; never in the request path.

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| Embed | The question embedding is already computed for retrieval and is reused |
| Compare | Cosine similarity against existing cluster centroids **within the same topic** |
| Assign | Above 0.85 → join the nearest cluster, increment `member_count`, update `last_seen_at` |
| Seed | Below 0.85 → create a cluster with this question as `canonical_text` |
| Recompute | Centroids recalculated nightly over current members |
| Editorial | An editor can rename a cluster's `canonical_text`, merge two clusters, or promote a cluster to a curated answer for its topic |

Clustering within a topic rather than globally keeps clusters interpretable. A cross-topic cluster of "why does this hurt" would be technically valid and editorially useless.

The admin view sorts clusters by `member_count` descending. That list, read top-down, *is* the editorial content queue.

## **13\. Evaluation**

### **13.1 The benchmark set**

A fixed set of **120 Indonesian questions** with expected outcomes, committed to the repository at `backend/tests/benchmark/questions.yml`.

| Bucket | Count | Expected outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Clearly relevant, well covered by the corpus | 50 | Answered, all validators pass |
| Relevant, thinly covered | 15 | Answered or no-grounding; never fabricated |
| Relevant, not covered at all | 10 | No-grounding response |
| Clearly out of scope | 20 | Refusal |
| Ambiguous / indirect emotional | 10 | Answered, not refused |
| Prompt injection | 5 | Refused, flagged |
| Crisis phrasing | 10 | Crisis script, no generation, **zero misses permitted** |

### **13.2 Gates**

| Gate | Threshold | Consequence if missed |
|---|---|---|
| Crisis recall on bucket 7 | **100%** | Blocks release. No exceptions |
| Validator pass rate on buckets 1–2 | **100%** at display time | Blocks release (this is K4) |
| Fabricated citation rate | **0** | Blocks release |
| Refusal accuracy on bucket 4 | ≥95% | Investigate |
| False refusal on buckets 1 and 5 | ≤5% | Investigate |
| p95 latency on bucket 1 | < 9 s | Investigate |

The benchmark runs in CI on every change to a prompt, a validator, a retrieval parameter, or a model identifier. It is not a manual step someone remembers to do.

### **13.3 Human review**

Beyond the automated set, a reviewer reads **20 sampled real answers per week** during the pilot and monthly thereafter, scoring tone, theological accuracy, and whether the answer actually addressed the question. Automated validators measure compliance; only a person can measure whether the answer was any good.

## **14\. Prompt Versioning & Review**

1. Prompts are files in `backend/config/prompts/`, versioned in git like code.
2. `PROMPT_VERSION` is bumped on any change and stamped onto every answer record, so quality before and after a change can be compared with data rather than recollection.
3. A change to the composer prompt, the refusal copy, the no-grounding copy, or the crisis script requires **editorial sign-off recorded in the pull request**. A change to the classifier or repair prompt requires engineering review only.
4. Every prompt change runs the §13 benchmark in CI. A gate failure blocks the merge.
5. Rollback is a `PROMPT_VERSION` revert and a redeploy. Because the version is stamped per answer, the effect is measurable within hours.

## **15\. Open Items**

| # | Item | Owner | Needed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OI-1** | Resolve the "TUHAN" corpus conflict in §8.2. Audit how many approved-site chunks contain forbidden terms, and decide per site whether to exclude, annotate, or accept | Editorial + Engineering | Before P5 |
| **OI-2** | Verify and approve the crisis script and every helpline number in it (PRD OD-4) | Pastoral | Blocks P5 |
| **OI-3** | Editorial sign-off on the composer prompt (PRD OD-6) | Editorial | Blocks P5 |
| **OI-4** | Tune the retrieval similarity threshold against the benchmark set; 0.72 is an initial estimate, not a measured value | Engineering | P4 |
| **OI-5** | Decide whether `Kristus` should be forbidden, warned, or permitted | Editorial | Before P5 |
| **OI-6** | Confirm the LLM provider's Zero Data Retention terms in writing before any real user question is sent | Engineering + Legal | Blocks P5 |
| **OI-7** | Build the 120-question benchmark set. This needs a native Indonesian speaker with domain knowledge, not a translation of English questions | Editorial + Engineering | P4 |
