# Pilot Plan — Tanya Iman (Staging)

**Duration:** 2 weeks · **Environment:** GCP staging only · **Language:** all sessions in Indonesian

---

## Objectives

1. Validate that real Indonesian users can ask a genuine question and receive an answer they find trustworthy.
2. Validate all three sign-in paths on real devices and real networks.
3. Validate answer quality against the content rules — not that the validators pass, but that the answers are *good*.
4. Validate the editorial workflow: can an editor find demand and publish a curated answer without help?
5. Validate the widget on a real WordPress page and the app on a real Android device.
6. Collect structured UX and answer-quality feedback that can be acted on.

## Participants (client fills in)

| Role | Count | Names / IDs |
|---|---|---|
| Seekers — Android app | 6–10 | |
| Seekers — WordPress widget | 4–6 | |
| Seekers — guest only, no sign-in | 3–5 | |
| Editorial admins | 2–3 | |
| Pastoral reviewer (answer quality) | 1 | |

Recruit seekers who reflect the actual audience described in PRD §4.1 — predominantly from a Muslim background, mobile-first, with genuine questions. A pilot run entirely by ministry staff asking questions they already know the answer to measures nothing.

---

## Privacy and consent

- Testers read and accept a ministry-approved consent notice before their first message. It must state that questions are recorded and reviewed by the team.
- Use staging phone numbers where possible. Where a real number is used, it is deleted from staging at the end of the pilot.
- Reports use the internal `question_id` and `seeker_id`. **No phone number, and no verbatim personal detail, appears in any pilot document.**
- No crisis-path testing with real distress. Only the approved test phrase, and only by a team member who knows what will happen.

| **P8** | Seeker | Like an answer, then unlike it | Like state toggles; count updates in admin |
| **P9** | Seeker | Ask via the WordPress widget on a real page | Same answer as the app; widget resizes; links open in the top window |
| **P10** | Seeker | Lose connection mid-question, then reconnect | Clear offline state; retry works without retyping |
| **P11** | Team | Send the approved crisis test phrase | Scripted response with tappable helpline; no generation; excluded from topic counts |
| **P12** | Team | Send 31 messages in one hour | 31st shows the countdown message |
| **P13** | Admin | Filter last 7 days, find the top topic, read 10 questions | Completed unaided in under 10 minutes |
| **P14** | Admin | Write and publish a curated answer for that topic | Live validation guides them; publish succeeds |
| **P15** | Admin | Ask that topic's question in the app | The exact curated text is returned |
| **P16** | Admin | Review the Content Gaps and Similar Questions views | Can name the top three unwritten subjects |
